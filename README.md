# Pivotal Tracker Mac App

especially useful if you're managing a project, because you can see
everything at a glance.

- Runs the PT site in a Mac app
- Full-screen mode

### Roadmap

- Hotkeys for adding a story and tab-switching for projects.
- Minimal menu system
- Notifications for new story assignments
